I do not store anything about you.

The website is self-hosted on my own server, located in France, and is fully static. This means that the server only serve HTML/CSS files, no pre-processing beforehand, no database.

About Javascript, I disabled everything related to privacy. No Google Analytics. 

The **only** request made to Google when surfing on this website is made to download the fonts. I will try to change this in a near future.

If you have any question about privacy, please send me a mail. I am not used to web in general, but I will do my best to answer you.
If you spot any tracker or anything that seems to track you on this website, I urge you to contact me with the details. I will check your claim and, if verified, remove the tracking part with no delay.

Comments may be enabled in the future. In order to keep the website fully static, it will probably require me to add some Javascript code. 
If this feature is added to the website, you will be warned at least 1 week before with a blog post explaining the change. 
I will also make sure that the comments posted are only stored on my server and not on a third party server. 

Here are some ideas of commenting frameworks that might suits the requirements:
1. https://github.com/skx/e-comments
2. https://github.com/posativ/isso/
3. https://github.com/debiki/talkyard
4. https://gitlab.com/commento/commento (self-hosted seems to be possible, and this framework is already included in Academic so it might be easier for me to setup this one)
5. https://schnack.cool
