This post is an introduction to a serie of posts that will talk
about my journey to ban most of Google products out of my life.

While reading this post that will be a fictional story, please
keep in mind one question: do you think that the story depicted
here will **never** happen? I will come back to this at the end of
the post, have a good read!


## Involved entities {#involved-entities}

1.  Pierre, 2040, fictionnal character.
2.  Google assistant.


## Story {#story}

**Pierre:** OK Google, can you please provide me an exhaustive list
of all the data you have on me?

**Google Assistant:** Sure, would you like me to upload the 10TB of
data to your Google Cloud? Your storage limit will need to be
increased beforehand.

**Pierre:** Wait, 10TB?! Can you describe what kind of information
are in these?

**Google Assistant:** Everything you agreed to let us collect. Most
of the 10TB are photos and videos from your phone that are
directly synced to Google cloud, but we also included your
geolocalisation history since the beginning, as well as...

**Pierre:** Wait, stop! What beginning?

**Google Assistant:** When you agreed to our terms and conditions,
back in 2008, don't you remember?

**Pierre:** No, not at all, could be more precise?

**Google Assistant:** It was the 28th of November, 2008. It was a
rainy day and, according to your geolocalisation data you were in
your flat in Toulouse, the one near the Capitole place. Do you
remember?

**Pierre:** No...

**Google Assistant:** According to my calculations, it was around
the time you and Sophie conceived Elsa and

**Pierre:** What?! How do you even know that?

**Google Assistant:** According to my data you searched the 26th of
November, 2008 "when do I have the highest chance of having a
baby" on what was your desktop back then.

**Pierre _thinking_:** Hummm, Sophie may have used my account to
search this.

**Google Assistant:** The last website you clicked on had a
partnship with Google and sent us the results they computed, which
was the 29th of November. According to your geolocalisation you
went to the Purpan hospital by car, making very unusual speed
excesses on the road, the 20th of August 2009. You
created a new account in 2015 to someone called Elsa and you
entered an age of 6 years old, with a parental filter on web
searches and daily reports mailed to your personal mail adress.

Do you want me to enumerate all the other related data? According
to my computations I will need 10 more minutes to show you all the
data I used for my prediction.

**Pierre:** No I don't need to know, you are frightening me right
now.

**Google Assistant:** Sorry, do you want me to tell you a joke? I
learned from the funnier!

**Pierre:** No. Could you instead stop spying on me and delete these
10TB
